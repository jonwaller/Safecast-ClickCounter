Radioactive click:
Audible for 0.001 second
But takes about 0.005 secs to reach zero again

Jon's android = 1.6 = API 4

For AudioRecord class:
CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MONO = API 4 and below
CHANNEL_IN_MONO = API 5 and above

Use setPositionNotificationPeriod(160) before the while loop. 
This should cause the callback to be called every time 160 frames are read. 
Instead of calling process(buffer) inside of the thread that's doing the read loop, call process(buffer) from the callback. 
Use a variable to keep track of the last read buffer so you process the right one. 
As it is now, you block on the read, then you're not reading while you're processing. 
I think it might be better to separate those two.

// buffer.length = 160
// Hz=8000 (cycles per second)
// 50 buffers a second
// 0.02secs a buffer
// 16 bytes=0.002secs
// click audible for 0.001 seconds (8 bytes)
// TODO make threshold double background level (as measured by mike)

// 8000Hz,so 0.02s (160b) an audioChunk
// Click is 0.001s so 8b
